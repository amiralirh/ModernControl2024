# ModernControl2024
A comprehensive modern control project covering nonlinear system modeling, linearization, static and integral compensator design, Luenberger observer implementation, stability and frequency analysis, and performance evaluation through MATLAB.


# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements advanced modern control techniques for a nonlinear dynamic system, based on a [published research paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382095639_Feedback_Linearized_Model_Predictive_Control_of_a_Two_Link_Robot_Arm).

The main goals of this project are:

- To model a nonlinear system.

- linearize the system around a specific operating point.

- design static and integral compensators.

- implement a Luenberger observer for state estimation.

- simulate and validate the complete control system.
