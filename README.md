# ModernControl2024
A comprehensive modern control project covering nonlinear system modeling, linearization, static and integral compensator design, Luenberger observer implementation, stability and frequency analysis, and performance evaluation through MATLAB.


ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements advanced modern control techniques for a nonlinear dynamic system, based on a published research paper.

The main goals of this project are:

- To model a nonlinear system.

- linearize the system around a specific operating point.

- design static and integral compensators.

- implement a Luenberger observer for state estimation.

- simulate and validate the complete control system.
