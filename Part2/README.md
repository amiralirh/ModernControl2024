# Part2

This main script analyzes the open-loop performance of the nonlinear system by applying three different types of inputs: step, ramp, and impulse. The primary goal is to evaluate the system's stability and transient response under these distinct conditions.

# Script Workflow
The script performs the following actions:

1.Defines the physical parameters and initial conditions for the system.

2.Simulates the system's behavior for each of the three input types.

3.Utilizes MATLAB's ode45 solver to integrate the system's differential equations.

4.Generates three separate plots to visualize the system's response to each input.
